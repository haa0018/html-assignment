        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p>My Name is Kiishi Haastrup, my friends call me Noki. I was born in Nigeria, Africa on 23<sup>rd</sup> of April 2001. I grew up with three dogs, so it was a very fun and active childhood. I finished High school and moved to Canada in 2019. I have a lot of interests ranging from sports to online activites.Sports being Track, soccer, volleyball, Basketball. Most recently my favourite activity is <em>playing</em> video games, kind of my therapy. Hopping on at night with the boys just playing and catching up</p>
        <p2>While in Canada, I have done a lot of things and met a lot of people. My journey so far in Canada has been fun and enlighten and it has shaped and molded my perception of life. I recently started dog sitting and have loved it for a while, mostly because I love dogs. I hope to see many more and do many more while in Canada. I am here with my family and they have really made my transition easy and comfortable enough</p2>
